## What is this?

This is a utility to create aliases for snaps that do not have 'official' aliases.

## How do I use it?

**At the moment:**
- This is literally a script that creates a file of commands to run.
- It does not have access to snapd and cannot directly rename apps to their aliases.
- You need to run it as a script like this:
```rjd-snapout.snap-out-how <snapname>
sudo /snap/rjd-snapout/current/bin/rjd-snap-expose.sh```
